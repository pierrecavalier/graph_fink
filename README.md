# Graph on fink
[Fink](https://fink-broker.org/){:target="_blank"} is a community driven project, open to anyone, that processes time-domains alert streams and connects them with follow-up facilities and science teams. Fink broker has been selected as a community broker to process the full stream of transient alerts from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Since 2020, we are processing the alert stream from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).

During a 4-month internship, we tried to explore the analysis of graphs for the broker's alerts, mainly for anomaly detection and a new similarity measure.

Data can be found [here](https://fink-portal.org/){:target="_blank"} and once put in a folder data, one can create his own graph.

The report details the code and how it is used.
